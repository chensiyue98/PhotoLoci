                <h2>Purpose & Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    PhotoLoci is designed to help you rediscover your memories by mapping your photo library. 
                    This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the PhotoLoci application. Our mission is to provide 
                    a beautiful and functional way to visualize your photo geography while respecting your privacy 
                    and keeping your data secure.
                </p>

                <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
                <p>We believe in data minimization. Here is a breakdown of the data we interact with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photos & Metadata:</strong> The app accesses your photo library to display images and read location metadata (EXIF data) to place them on the map. This processing happens entirely on your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-Provided Location Info:</strong> If you choose to add location data to photos that lack it, this information is stored locally or within the photo's metadata, depending on your actions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search Queries:</strong> When you search for locations within the app, these queries are processed to find the coordinates on the map.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diagnostics & Analytics:</strong> We may collect anonymous diagnostic data (crashes, performance issues) and optional analytics to help us improve the app. This data is not linked to your personal identity.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Location Handling</h2>
                <p>
                    Your location privacy is paramount.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Precise Location:</strong> We only use your precise location when you explicitly use features like adding a pin to your current location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> The app requests Location Services permissions to show your position on the map and to tag photos. You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Photos & Media</h2>
                <p>
                    Your photos are yours. PhotoLoci does not upload your photos to any external server.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All photo analysis and map clustering are performed locally on your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> We read photo metadata (date, time, location) to organize your library. Reverse geocoding (finding the city/country name from coordinates) is performed using Apple's system frameworks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Your photos and their metadata remain on your device unless you explicitly choose to share or export them.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Permissions & Access</h2>
                <p>To function correctly, PhotoLoci requires access to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To display your photos and read their location data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Services:</strong> To show your current location on the map.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We do not retain or store your Apple ID or other credentials. All data access is mediated through standard Apple APIs, ensuring you control the access levels.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>System Services:</strong> Some data, like map search queries, may be processed by system services (e.g., Apple Maps) to function, subject to their respective privacy policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose data if required by law, though since we do not store your user data on our servers, we generally possess no data to disclose.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Since data is processed on-device, it remains there as long as the app is installed or until you delete it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resetting Data:</strong> You can reset location information or cache within the app settings if applicable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Deleting the app from your device will remove all local data associated with PhotoLoci.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Security Measures</h2>
                <p>
                    We employ industry-standard security measures.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On-Device Storage:</strong> By keeping your data on your device, we leverage the robust security protections of the iOS/iPadOS/macOS platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Frameworks:</strong> We use secure system frameworks for all data handling.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>User Rights</h2>
                <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Review & Change:</strong> You can review and change Photos and Location permissions in your device's Settings app at any time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact:</strong> If you have questions about your privacy rights, please contact us.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <p>
                    We may update this policy from time to time. Significant changes will be notified via an app update or a notice within the app.
